# Vulkan Multi-GPU Split Mode Graph

## Design Principles

- **Vendor-neutral**: All changes use Vulkan spec features only (no driver-specific extensions). Works on RADV, NVIDIA proprietary, ANV (Intel), lavapipe, etc.
- **NVIDIA-safe**: No changes to CUDA/NCCL paths. Vulkan backend changes use standard Vulkan 1.2+ APIs (timeline semaphores, host-visible staging). NVIDIA's Vulkan driver supports all of these.
- **Upstreamable**: Minimal, surgical changes. Phase 1 (async+events) is a standalone improvement that benefits single-GPU Vulkan too. Each phase can be upstreamed independently.
- **Host-staging model**: Cross-device transfers go through host-visible memory (GPU A → host → GPU B). This is the only portable approach in the Vulkan spec. Phase 12 adds optional dmabuf P2P for RADV.

## File Layout

- `ggml/src/ggml-vulkan.cpp` — direct submodule edits for vtable wiring, event functions, async paths
- `ggml/src/ggml-vulkan-multigpu.cpp` — **new file** for split buffer type, cross-device staging, topology
- `ggml/include/ggml-vulkan.h` — public API additions (split buffer type)
- `src/llama.cpp` — integration points for split mode graph

## Upstreamability Notes

| Phase | Upstream Risk | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | Low | Enables existing disabled code + adds standard event API |
| 2 | Medium | New split buffer type, mirrors CUDA pattern exactly |
| 3 | Medium | Cross-device copy via staging, clean fallback path |
| 4 | Medium | Async pipeline, needs careful testing on multiple vendors |
| 5 | Low | Read-only topology query, no behavioral change |
| 6 | Low-Medium | Scalar fallbacks and graceful stubs improve non-AVX2 builds; lavapipe fixes are additive |
| 7 | Medium | Replaces sync fence with timeline semaphore in copy path |
| 8 | Low | Internal buffer management change, no API impact |
| 9 | Low | Parallel uploads, independent per-device operations |
| 10 | Medium-High | Changes graph_compute contract from sync to async; scheduler must call synchronize |
| 11 | Medium-High | Adds cross-queue dependencies within a device; complex synchronization |
| 12 | Low (optional) | Driver-specific, behind capability probe, clean fallback |

## Performance Impact Summary

| Phase | Primary Benefit | Workload |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| 7 | Eliminates fence stall per cross-device copy | All multi-GPU |
| 8 | Overlaps staging with compute | Prompt processing |
| 9 | Parallel model loading | Startup time |
| 10 | Overlaps graph execution across GPUs | Prompt processing |
| 11 | Overlaps DMA with compute on same GPU | Bandwidth-bound ops |
| 12 | 2x cross-device bandwidth (RADV only) | All multi-GPU |
